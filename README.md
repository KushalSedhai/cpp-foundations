# C++ Foundations 🚀

This repository documents my journey of learning **Modern C++** from scratch to an advanced level, with the long-term goal of becoming a **Software Engineer at a top tech company**.

I will be writing C++ every day and progressively building skills in:
- Core C++
- OOP & design patterns
- STL & algorithms
- Memory management & pointers
- Modern C++ (C++11/14/17/20)
- Clean code & debugging
- System-level thinking and DSA integration
